 List five standard-library containers.
 
**vector** - A dynamic array, with the ability to resize itself automatically when inserting or erasing an object.  
**list** - A doubly linked list.  
**set**	- A mathematical set. Provides set operations union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference and test of inclusion.  
**map** -	An associative array. Allows mapping from one data item (a key) to another (a value).  
**pair** - The pair container is a simple associative container consisting of a 2-tuple of data elements or objects, called 'first' and 'second', in that fixed order.
